## Elevator Pitch

This project is a cross-platform desktop game based on Unity with a graphical interface and advanced game logic, developed by a team of enterprising students. The project is aimed at developers and end users and is focused on creating a stable and scalable gaming system. The work involves the implementation of key technical modules, including autonomous agents implementing different decision-making and behavioural models for emergent gameplay, simulation of physical processes to expand game mechanics, and interaction with a remote database via a backend API. The goal of the project is to provide a reusable architecture for integrating AI-driven enemies, physics simulation and networked state management in Unity projects. A distinctive feature is the independent development of a server API and its integration with the Unity game client and a remote database, which forms an expandable technical base for further game development.
